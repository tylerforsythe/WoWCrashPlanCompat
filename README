Quick .NET tray app that monitors for World of Warcraft (WoW.exe) and, if found, suspends the CrashPlan service. If not found, it ensures the CrashPlan service is running.

For some reason, on one of my computers, CrashPlan running in the background results in bad stutter in WoW. I threw this together to resolve the issue.
